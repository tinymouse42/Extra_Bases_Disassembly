# Extra Bases (coin-op arcade game)

This disassembly was started by myself a LONG time ago. There is much to write in this README file but it will have to wait as I have other obligations at the moment.
It is a extrememly rudimentry "bare bones" disassembly and the last update was about 2017. In my work directories from that long ago I do have a listing file from where I compiled it but I don't know if it runs. 

Please note that this code was formatted to be compiled with TASM, so it may take a bit of conversion to get it to compile with ZMAC.

This README.md file will be updated with more details later.
